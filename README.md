## Hurdles

- Finding a reliable API was a hurdle in itself. I had trouble finding an API that would suite my project idea, ultimately I decided to use an API that would be reliable and built my React App around it.

- It was challenging deploying the react website due to API sometimes being buggy.

- When making websites, I always try to make my website look very good looking, and have a modern feel to it. I had trouble styling it due to its simplicity.
